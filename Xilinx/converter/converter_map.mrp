Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors   :   2
Number of warnings :   0

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:Pack:679 - Unable to obey design constraints (LOC=AA5) which require the
   combination of the following symbols into a single IOB component:
   	BUF symbol "twos_comp_obuf(0)" (Output Signal = twos_comp(0))
   	PAD symbol "twos_comp(0)" (Pad Signal = twos_comp(0))
   	PAD symbol "sign_mag(0)" (Pad Signal = sign_mag(0))
   More than one pad symbol.  Please correct the design constraints accordingly.
ERROR:Pack:679 - Unable to obey design constraints (LOC=AA6) which require the
   combination of the following symbols into a single IOB component:
   	BUF symbol "twos_comp_obuf(1)" (Output Signal = twos_comp(1))
   	PAD symbol "twos_comp(1)" (Pad Signal = twos_comp(1))
   	PAD symbol "sign_mag(1)" (Pad Signal = sign_mag(1))
   More than one pad symbol.  Please correct the design constraints accordingly.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
