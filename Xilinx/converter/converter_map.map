Mapping design into LUTs...
Running directed packing...
ERROR:Pack:679 - Unable to obey design constraints (LOC=AA5) which require the
   combination of the following symbols into a single IOB component:
   	BUF symbol "twos_comp_obuf(0)" (Output Signal = twos_comp(0))
   	PAD symbol "twos_comp(0)" (Pad Signal = twos_comp(0))
   	PAD symbol "sign_mag(0)" (Pad Signal = sign_mag(0))
   More than one pad symbol.  Please correct the design constraints accordingly.
